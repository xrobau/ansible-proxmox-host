** THIS IS A PROXMOX SERVER MANAGED BY ANSIBLE **

This machine has been deployed using the ansible-proxmox-host playbook.

WARNING: When this machine is rebooted it will ALWAYS USE KEXEC.

If you have changed the kernel params, they will not take effect
as the default setting is --reuse-cmdline. Edit the kexec-load.service
file in /etc/systemd/system with the correct params, and run
systemctl daemon-reload. Or just do a full reboot.

To force a full system reboot use 'systemctl --force reboot'

{% if ipmi.stdout %}
IPMI Address of this machine is {{ ipmi.stdout }}
{% else %}
{% if noipmi is not defined %}
WARNING: No IPMI Address for this machine could be discovered!

If this machine does NOT have IPMI, create an empty file /etc/noipmi
to supress this warning and run ansible again.
{% else %}
This machine DOES NOT have IPMI hardware (/etc/noipmi exists)
